# server-parameterization

Super lightweight library for abstracting NodeJS parameterization.

## Philosophical and Technical Design Goals:

  - classic staticly-compiled-language features like type-safety and find-all-reference capability
  - DRYness
  - framework-agnosticism (currently using NestJS/common [22kB] for controllers to display values but will remove)
  - composability
  - simplicity
